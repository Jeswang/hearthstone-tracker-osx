hearthstone-tracker-osx
=======================

Hearthstone tracker built for Mac OS X

## General

* The application reads logs the game puts out to parse what is happening. 
* It's a background application (only using a status bar icon).
* It shows if Hearthstone is running in the main window.

### Note

The logs doesn't say when someone concedes, so this needs to get some other kind of solution. At the moment you can either claim win/loss per game.
